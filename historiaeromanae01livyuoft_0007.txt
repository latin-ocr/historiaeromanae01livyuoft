TO THE R EA DER.
—„‚0-—

AMONG the classic authors ,of the best, or, as it is not
infrequently stylcd‚ the Golden Age of Latinity‚ the first
rank as a prose writer has boen assigned to Livy; and
rightly too, as we shall find if we compare him with
either Cicero, or Julius Caesar, or Sallust, all of whom he
excels as well in his subject as in its treatment. What in
all heathen antiquity was more glorious than the history
of the Roman people from the earliest period to the reign
of Augustus Caesar? This was the subject which the
genius of Livy aspires] to grasp, and to which he devoted
more than twenty years of literary labour. The varied
beautics of style and composition which he displays‚ the
sustaincd interest of the narrative, the noble pieces ofora-
tory, and the many char-ming episodes and digressions
which he intersperses, all justify the opinion⁷ that if he
was fortunate in having chosen a subject so great and so
important, he has at least shown that he was not inade—
quate to the occasion. It has indeed been objected to
him that he is too crecIquus, the foundation of the charge
being that he has embodied in his history the old national
traditions‚ those fond and proud recollections of early
heroic times, which grace and adorn the maj cstic narrative,
in which he so vividly depicts the rise and progress of
the Roman state, from the dominion of a single city,
growing greater and greater, till in his own period it
might be regarded as having the empire of “all the world”.
