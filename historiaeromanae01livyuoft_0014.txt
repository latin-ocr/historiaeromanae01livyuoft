and although the notes and comments are in Latin, that
circumstance presents no difficulty to the really diligent
student. The best and soundest scholars were formed in
the times when the universal language of learning was
also that of Classical instruction to all except the lowest
form. Nor is the time very remote in which, by means
of this language, the authors of every European country
reeiprocally communicated their observations and disco-
veries in science, which at present must be “cabin’cl,
cribb'd, confin'd'' within the limits of a single vernacular
language, unless released by translation into some other,
with almost a certainty of injury by errors committed in
the process.

WVhether the Latin is ever to resume its ancient supre-
macy may be doubtful, especially as the tendeney of the
present age is rather to the acquisition of showy and
superficial, than of real and profound schola-rship. But
whoever desires to become proficient in classical criticism
, and pffllology, must obtain access to the rich treasures of
such learning which are contained in Latin books, and
that his researches may not be tedious and laborious, he
must study to become familiar With not only the ancient
classieal writers, but with the great masters who have
flourished since the revival of learning. If Cicero and
Virgil, Sallust, Livy, Tacitus, and Horace be deemed
essential to a liberal education, not less so should be
Sedulius, Vida, Sannazarius, Casimir, Strada, and Oso-
rius, who in later times have written Latin, with a grace
and fluency not sul-passed even by the ancient Romans
