aceuraey and excellent typography.

That of Amsterdam, 1665, in 3 vols., 8vo, by Grono-
vius, is valuable as a commodioris book of reference.

The Parisian edition, in usum Delphini, 1679, by
Doujat, in 6 vols.‚ 4to, contains, besides the remaining
text, also the supplements of Freinsheimins for one hun-
dred and five lost books, and those of Doujatius for snp-
plying the lacunae of those that have been preserved.

Dodwell, formerly of Trinity College, Dublin, and after-
wards Camden Professor of History at Oxford‚ who de-
cides against its claim to be the work of Livy.

and deservedly commended by the historian, Edward
Gibbon.
