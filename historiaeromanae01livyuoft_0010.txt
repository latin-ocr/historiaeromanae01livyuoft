sortieth very imperfect. Several other editions followed
before the year 1500. From that time they have been
very numerous, and of every sizc and form that is in use.
The Zweybruggen editors in 1784 give, in fifty closely
printed octavo pages, an enumeration of the editions and
translations down to their period. It would be largely
augmented if continued to the present time. We can
only mention a few of the chief editions.

In that of Mentz, 1518, folio, two parts were added;

From that period there have been no further dis-
