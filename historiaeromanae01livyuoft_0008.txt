iv To THE READER.

Niebuhr and other sceptical writers have laboured to dis-
credit the ancient history of Rome. For the accounts we
have received from the Latin historians, they would sub-
stitute their own arbitrary conjectures3 for what is posi-
tive and ascertained, if we are to have faith in preceding
