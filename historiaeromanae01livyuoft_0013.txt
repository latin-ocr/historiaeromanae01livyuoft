'1⁷0 THE READEH. ix

clusion. The ‘first volume having appeared in 1797, the
seventh, which is the last, in 1813.

The Dublin University Calendar of 1862 says: “Mr.
&Valker was the editor of the well—known edition of Livy,
published at the University Press in 1797''. But this
certainly is erroneous, as only the first volume was pub-
lished in 17973 the second in 17993 the third in 18Ο9;
the fourth in 18103 the fifth and sixth in 18113 and the
seventh not until 1813.

Mr. VValker held 1115 fellowship in Trinity College,
Dublin, until October, 1804, when his connection with
that society ceased‚ but not 111 the manner stated in the
Dublin University Calendar‚ which is directly contrary
to the account repeatedly given in public by himself, and
never contradicted during his life. He continued his
attention to the Classical and seientific studies of Trinity
CoHege, Dublin, Which he promoted by several publiea·-
tions, most- of which were adopted by the University as
text books. His Selections from Lueian7 and his Com-
mentary 011 the College Logie, were remarkably suc-

His Philosophy of Arithmetic7 and his Euclid in General
Terms, are equally well calculated to make scientific pro⁶
positions and their proofs easily intelligible. He was
engaged in editing the Odyssey of Homer for the Unin
versity of Dublin, and had about half of the work eom-
pleted‚ When his death interrupted it in 1833. It was
completed as a posthumous publication by his son, who,‚
if he had 110 other iliberitance, at least succeeded to his
father's classica] taste‚ and to much, if not the entire, of
his erudition.

His Livy is still that which 15 studied by candidates for
sizarships, for seholarships, and other honours at exami-
nations in Trinity College, Dublin. It is finmd by a long
